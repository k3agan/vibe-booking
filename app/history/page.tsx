      <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
        The Capitol Hill Community Hall was constructed in 1947-1948 as a non-partisan public space to serve a variety of community groups, including groups with different political views and religious affiliations. The ability of the founding members to set their differences aside and work collaboratively to construct the hall for the benefit of the wider community is an enduring part of the hall's legacy.

      <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
        The first meeting of the Capitol Hill Community Hall Association held in the building took place on December 16th, 1947, and final construction work completed in February 1948. An extension was added later in 1948, to extend the building to its current size.

          <strong>Architect:</strong> Harold Cullerne (1890-1976) designed the two-storey community hall in 1943. After returning from service during the First World War, he joined J.H. Bowman in a partnership that lasted from 1919 to 1934. After Bowman retired in 1934, Cullerne practiced on his own, continuing to work on schools and institutional buildings, such as the Art Deco Hollywood Theatre in Vancouver.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body2" paragraph>
          <strong>Construction:</strong> Wood-framed construction with large attic space. Built in two parts as seen by different construction detailing in the attic, ceiling panels, and foundation walls as per recorded minutes. The building was constructed through volunteer labour, including the work of William James Dynes who served as the project foreman, and George Green who served as the Chairman of the Building Committee.
